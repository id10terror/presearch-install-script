# presearch-install-script
(Unofficial) Presearch Node Install Script using docker-compose (currently only supports Ubuntu)

## Run Command in Terminal
###

curl -sSL https://github.com/id10terror/presearch-install-script/raw/main/presearch-node-install-ubuntu.sh | sudo bash
````

## Node Registration Code
When prompted for Presearch Node Registration code, browse to https://nodes.presearch.org/dashboard, copy "Your node registration code", and paste code in terminal.

---

## How To BACKUP Keys
*If you originally used the one-liner from the official Presearch team docs, you can back up using these steps:*
###
1. On the original node's server, ensure your node is CURENTLY RUNNING and run this command:
```bash
docker cp presearch-node:/app/node/.keys presearch-node-keys
```
#

*If you originally used this script to install and configure your nodes:*
###
1. Simply browse to the `/opt/docker/presearch/app/node/.keys` directory on your host filesystem and copy the files to a second location.

---

## How To RESTORE Keys

1. After backing up your keys from your old node, run the script on the new node you wish to restore the keys on. 
2. When prompted, leave the Registration key blank, and press Enter.
3. Press CTRL+C to exit the streaming log.
4. Run this command to stop the containers temporarily:
```bash
$(cd /opt/docker/presearch && docker-compose stop)
```
5. Browse to the `/opt/docker/presearch/app/node/.keys` directory on your host filesystem, and replace the keys with the ones backed up earlier.
6. Set permissions on keys
```bash
chmod 644 /opt/docker/presearch/app/node/.keys/*
```
8. Run this command to recreate and start the containers:
```bash
$(cd /opt/docker/presearch && docker-compose up -d --force-recreate) &&  docker logs -f presearch-node
```
8. If you did this correctly, you should see a line like this in the log `info: Node is listening for searches...`

###

*If you see a Duplicate Node error in the log, make sure you have stopped the container in the old node, then wait 30 seconds or so for the error to clear on the new node.*
